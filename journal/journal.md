### Related project 1 ###
*Gravity of light*

*https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/led-hat*

![Image](Proj1.png)

This project is related to mine because of the way it uses light and movement to create an interactive item. this hat reacts to differnt movements and wil display a light show according to them.

### Related project 2 ###
*Arduino Accelerometer Data Logger Project*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EBpjjKGRJQ*

![Image](Proj2.png)

This project is related to mine because of the use of an accelerometre. using an accelerometre the man craeted a data logger to learn about what happens when a car accelerwates and goes around corners.

### Related project 3 ###
*Great Street Games*

*https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/great-street-games*

![Image](Proj3.png)

This project is related to mine because of its use of movement and coreponding light shows. this project gets a community involved to play games with light.

### Related project 4 ###
*gesture controled robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejZmqRrKMc*

![Image](Proj4.png)

This project is related to mine because of its use of motion using an accelerometer. using an accelerometer and the directional movemnt of the users had the robot will move according to the controller.

### Related project 5 ###
*Color Mountain*

*https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/color-mountain*

![Image](Proj5.png)

This project is related to mine because through motion of people on a snowboard different lights are being projected onto the snow hills.

### Related project 6 ###
*Arduino Project-Self Balancing Robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6z26LVu5y0*

This project is related to mine because using the accelerometer it corrects its orrientation to stay up right.

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
Create a interactive device that displays lights/Information depending on movement

### Design concept 1 ###
a cube with multiple faces and functions. for example, one side displays time, one temperature, one weather. using the accelerometre it can detect what side its facing and display the correspodning information. 

### Design concept 2 ###
a mood tracker. a small device with a series of steps it can be placed on. depending on your mood each day you can put the device higher or lower and it will display a color depending on what mood step youve put it on. could be a good way to tell people how your feeling without saying it.

### Final design concept ###
an object that sits niceley on a bedside table that is flipped to different sides to create different light show. examples like a a fast stobe to pair with some music for a bedroom party. a slow transitioning color wheel for if you need something mellow to fill the room. single color projection to fill a room with a certain color. a regular light to make a room brighter.


## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

![Image](Code1.png)

for the materials i used an old workbook holder that was made from a thing wood wrapped in a strong cardboard. this gave me a solid material that would hold aswell as a paintable surface.

i then cut a circle in the hexagon that was going to hold the neopixel. the initial hole fit the neopixel perfectly, though i put a small amount of hot glue on it to hold firmly.

heres a picture of it after it was all glues together, still quite rough and not completley painted.

## Final code ##

the first code image shows the basics for each roation of the microbit

![Image](FinalCode1.JPG)

this second one shows how long the code was for changing the colors slowly and fast. its not he complete code but it continues in the exact pattern fro quite a bit longer as the calm changing light changes each color value very slightly per line and goes through every number.

## Design process discussion ##
By first sitting down and writing ideas down i was able to come up with a rough intent, and it was only after talking about it on the disscussion board that i refined it. reseaching others projects help me develop ideas for lighting aswell as coding for my prototype and materials i might want to look into for the future.

## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

there were so any neopixel microbit projects on the interent which were incrdible helpful to me. after watching quite a few i was very comfortable creating the code and plugin in the neoxpisel whilst understanding what i was doing without having to go back to sorces to double check.

i felt the shape of my project made it novel. the sharp block like design is different to a normal looking lighting feature that is sold on the market.

an extention to this project could combine my use of the x axis with a y access acceleration to maybe change the strength or speed of lights.
